@inproceedings{baker01:equivalence,
  abstract = {There are two major formulations of image alignment using gradient descent. The first estimates an additive increment to the parameters (the additive approach), the second an incremental warp (the compositional approach). We first prove that these two formulations are equivalent. A very efficient algorithm was proposed by Hager and Belhumeur (1998) using the additive approach that unfortunately can only be applied to a very restricted class of warps. We show that using the compositional approach an equally efficient algorithm (the inverse compositional algorithm) can be derived that can be applied to any set of warps which form a group. While most warps used in computer vision form groups, there are a certain warps that do not. Perhaps most notable is the set of piecewise affine warps used in flexible appearance models (FAMs). We end this paper by extending the inverse compositional algorithm to apply to FAMs.},

@article{cootes:tps,
  abstract = {Face images are difficult to interpret because they are highly variable. Sources of variability include individual appearance, 3D pose, facial expression, and lighting. We describe a compact parametrized model of facial appearance which takes into account all these sources of variability. The model represents both shape and gray-level appearance, and is created by performing a statistical analysis over a training set of face images. A robust multiresolution search algorithm is used to fit the model to faces in new images. This allows the main facial features to be located, and a set of shape, and gray-level appearance parameters to be recovered. A good approximation to a given face can be reconstructed using less than 100 of these parameters. This representation can be used for tasks such as image coding, person identification, 3D pose recovery, gender recognition, and expression recognition. Experimental results are presented for a database of 690 face images obtained under widely varying conditions of 3D pose, lighting, and facial expression. The system performs well on all the tasks listed above},

@inproceedings{wu:boosted_ranking,
  abstract = {Face alignment seeks to deform a face model to match it with the features of the image of a face by optimizing an appropriate cost function. We propose a new face model that is aligned by maximizing a score function, which we learn from training data, and that we impose to be concave. We show that this problem can be reduced to learning a classifier that is able to say whether or not by switching from one alignment to a new one, the model is approaching the correct fitting. This relates to the ranking problem where a number of instances need to be ordered. For training the model, we propose to extend GentleBoost [23] to rank-learning. Extensive experimentation shows the superiority of this approach to other learning paradigms, and demonstrates that this model exceeds the alignment performance of the state-of-the-art.},

  abstract = {The Active Appearance Model (AAM) is a powerful generative method for modeling and registering deformable visual objects. Most methods for AAM fitting utilize a linear parameter update model in an iterative framework. Despite its popularity, the scope of this approach is severely restricted, both in fitting accuracy and capture range, due to the simplicity of the linear update models used. In this paper, we present an new AAM fitting formulation, which utilizes a nonlinear update model. To motivate our approach, we compare its performance against two popular fitting methods on two publicly available face databases, in which this formulation boasts significant performance improvements.},
